/* diskio.c -- CP/M-86 disk FILE* seam for Open Watcom's GENUINE stdio layer.
 *
 * rc7xx-work#7 milestone 3, remaining half: lift the console-only write seam
 * (port/stdioshim.c) to a full disk FILE* path so fopen/fread/fwrite/fprintf/
 * fgets/fseek/ftell against real CP/M-86 disk files work through Watcom's
 * UNCHANGED stdio. This file SUPERSEDES stdioshim.c in the disk build: it owns
 * the same console __qwrite + isatty seam AND adds the five low-level primitives
 * fopen bottoms out into -- _sopen / __qread / __qwrite / __close / __lseek --
 * backed by CP/M-86 FCB BDOS calls (INT 0E0h). No DOS INT 21h anywhere.
 *
 * CP/M-86 record model (why this is not just "read()/write()"): CP/M has no
 * byte-granular file length -- storage is 128-byte records only. We use the
 * RANDOM-record BDOS calls (READ RANDOM fn 33 / WRITE RANDOM fn 34), which makes
 * byte position trivial: record = pos>>7, in-record offset = pos&127. A record
 * that has never been written reads back as EOF; we then fill the work buffer
 * with Ctrl-Z (0x1A), so a partially-written last record keeps a Ctrl-Z tail on
 * disk -- exactly CP/M's text-EOF convention, produced for free. On read, text
 * mode stops at the first Ctrl-Z; binary mode does not (a binary file's length
 * is only known to the nearest 128 bytes -- an inherent CP/M limitation, so
 * binary callers must track their own length).
 *
 * Text/binary '\n' <-> "\r\n" translation is done ABOVE this seam by Watcom's
 * text-mode fgetc/fputc (driven by the FILE flag fopen sets from the "t"/"b"
 * mode), so __qread/__qwrite move RAW bytes -- same boundary as the console
 * seam. We additionally enforce the Ctrl-Z text-EOF here because the record
 * model, not a byte count, delimits the file.

 *
 * WHY this exists: BDOS reads the FCB at DS:DX. The old _bdos assumed DS==DGROUP
 * (true only in near-data models). Under the LARGE model (-ml, far data) DS
 * floats -- e.g. set_dma() touches dma[] and leaves DS==dma's segment, so a

 * lived at DGROUP 1CF1 -> BDOS saw an empty name '' and never matched the file.

 * of the ambient DS. (The DMA buffer is targeted separately via BD_SETDMASEG, an

   scans argv for the redirect operators, opens each named file as an ordinary
   disk file (fd >= DISK_FIRST_FD), and records that fd here. __qread/__qwrite --

   stdin/stdout FILE objects keep handles 0/1 and their buffering untouched.

   stderr (handle 2) is deliberately NOT rerouted by `>`, matching Unix shells:
   `prog > out.txt` still lets diagnostics reach the console.

   Worked example -- command tail " < IN.TXT > OUT.TXT":

     __apply_redirection opens IN.TXT (fd 3, redir_in=3), OUT.TXT (fd 4,

 * OWN fclose path -- fclose calls (*__RmTmpFileFn)(fp) whenever _TMPFIL is set,
 * so we set that flag and point the hook at rm_tmpfile below. Worked example:
 * first call yields "TMP00000.$$$"; tmpfile() fopen()s it "wb+", registers
